This project is a remix of a project built in pure HTML, CSS and JS.
In this project, the emphasis was on reusing components for such types of questions as with text input, checkbox input, radio input and drag drops.

Also, all data is stored in local storage, which allows you to continue the test in the event of a page refresh.
